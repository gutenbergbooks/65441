  <h2 class='c005'>LEARNING TO SPELL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Are we spelling as well in our schools today as our forefathers
did in the little red schoolhouse? This is the question
that has been asked many times but no one has been
able to answer it in any convincing way. There have been
advocates of both sides of the question. The fact remains
that no one knows. We do not know how well children
could spell fifty, or even twenty-five, years ago. As time
goes by there is a glamour thrown over the past and we see
only the high lights. We remember that in spelling a match
there was a certain boy, or girl, who spelled down the entire
school time after time, or possibly had a reputation for
being the best speller in the entire county. When a spelling
match was announced it was a foregone conclusion that
the victory lay between two or three pupils. How many
children of the eighth grade could spell the following list
of words?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>phthisicky</div>
      <div class='line'>ichthyology</div>
      <div class='line'>abstemious</div>
      <div class='line'>demoniacal</div>
      <div class='line'>magisterial</div>
      <div class='line'>convalesce</div>
      <div class='line'>calligraphy</div>
      <div class='line'>saccharin</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>We remember the pupils who were able to spell these
difficult words, and we forget those who were unable to spell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>them. We remember the good spellers and forget how many
poor ones there were.</p>

<p class='c008'>The question is not whether one or two could spell, or
learn to spell such words, but could nearly every pupil in
the school spell such words? If they could, what use did
they make of their knowledge? The corollary to the
proposition is, how many were unable to spell “which,”
“there,” “writing,” “guess,” and a thousand other common
words? The question then is fairly before us; viz., <i>What
is the object of teaching spelling?</i></p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Object of Teaching Spelling</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Ever since the school of early days spelling has accompanied
“reading, ’riting, and ’rithmetic” as a part of
the curriculum. The day when reading was taught by the
“spelling method,” so called, is not far back in the past.
“How can one learn to read if one does not know his letters,
that he may be able to spell out the words that he meets
in his reading?” Not until recently has the question been
asked, “Why do we study spelling at all?” Do we need it
in our reading? Modern methods have shown us that we
do not. We need to know how to spell only when we wish
to write. How often does the average person write
“phthisicky,” “magisterial,” “ichthyology,” “convalesce,”
and other equally uncommon words? Not often, perhaps
never. Then why spend the time of our overcrowded school
day in having children try to learn these words, when numerous
recent investigations show positively that children
are constantly misspelling “which,” “there,” “their,” and
many other common, everyday words?</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Teaching versus Testing</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>For many years the spelling lesson has been, with many
teachers, a means of obtaining a breathing space in the day’s
work. It was comparatively easy to say to the children
“Take the next twenty words.” The study of these words
took some time, and it was easy work to dictate the lesson
at the end of fifteen or twenty minutes, have the pupils
exchange papers, and correct the words. What was the net
result at the end of the year? No one knew. Had they
tested the right words for the given grade? No one knew.
They had tested the words that were given in the spelling
book adopted by the city, town, or state. Most of the
books contained from 10,000 to 12,000 words. That the
children did not use many of these words in their written
work made little or no difference. In some cases at least,
the author of a spelling book took the dictionary and
started with the <i>a’s</i> and proceeded through the alphabet,
deciding that the children ought to know how to spell this
word, and that word, and so on through the dictionary,
No attempt was made to find out whether the pupil used
the words or not, and no attempt was made to place the
words according to their use in the proper grade.</p>

<p class='c008'>Was it possible for a teacher using such a book to test
the right words? Probably not. She tested all she could.
She assigned ten words a day for about 150 days during
the year, or if she dared, or the course of study called for
it, twenty, or twenty-five words were given in the upper
grades. The teacher was compelled to do so in order <i>to
finish the speller</i>. Did she <i>teach</i> the words? How could she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>teach even the ten words in the short time allowed? In
order that spelling words might be <i>taught</i> some teachers
suggested that five new words a day would be sufficient
to meet the needs of the pupil. The answer of many
teachers, following ancient traditions, shows that they
think that this would be unwise. Not to teach “which,”
“there,” “their,” and such words until the upper grades
certainly would be even more unwise.</p>

<p class='c008'>Teachers have had the mistaken idea that children learn
to spell many words because of constant use, and that there
is no need of teaching them. Recent studies have shown
that this is not true except with respect to occasional children
who have already developed what has been called a <i>spelling
consciousness</i>. In the vast majority of cases this spelling
consciousness needs to be developed. To accomplish
this words have to be selected, and carefully and systematically
taught, to most children. The selection of words,
therefore, is an important work of the author of a spelling
book.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thanks to recent investigations the day has come when
two important questions are being asked:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd><i>What</i> words ought we to <i>teach</i>?
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd><i>How</i> shall these selected words be taught?
    </dd>
    </dl>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Selection of a Vocabulary</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>In the past teachers have had little or nothing to do with
the selection of the widely differing vocabularies which they
have had to teach. The best of our teachers have attempted
to select a reasonable list from the spelling book which has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>been provided. That selection, however, has been limited
by the spelling book in use, the vocabulary of which has
already been selected, and may or may not be a reasonable
one. The question may even be raised, “To what extent
can teachers intelligently select the vocabulary which should
be taught?” In 1914 teachers of the city of Boston chosen
from all the elementary grades, were asked to make a selection
of words fitted for their respective grades. The significant
thing in their report was that the second grade teachers
chose not only words which should be taught in the second
grade, but also words which eventually should be taught
in each later grade; and many teachers of the eighth grade
selected words which should have been taught in a previous
grade. “Always,” for example, was in the list of
one or more teachers of every grade, I to VIII inclusive.
Many other words were in the lists of teachers of several
grades.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1916 Jones’s “Hundred Demons” (see page 22, Part
III) were given to forty-five second grade teachers for them
to select the words which should be retained in the second
grade. Seventy-nine of these words are among Ayres’s
“Thousand Commonest Words in the English Language.”
Every word was voted to be retained by one, or more
than one, <i>second</i> grade teacher as suitable to be taught to
second grade pupils.</p>

<p class='c008'>A group of twenty-eight prospective Boston teachers,
who had had some experience in the grades as practice
teachers, and much experience in observation, was asked
to arrange the following list of words in the order of their
difficulty:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>ache</div>
      <div class='line'>enough</div>
      <div class='line'>direction</div>
      <div class='line'>company</div>
      <div class='line'>business</div>
      <div class='line'>hoped</div>
      <div class='line'>ocean</div>
      <div class='line'>muscle</div>
      <div class='line'>sentence</div>
      <div class='line'>whether</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The directions given were to place the easiest word, in so
far as its spelling difficulty was concerned, first, and the
most difficult word last, the others to be arranged according
to the difficulty of each. After the several lists were
collected it was found that each of the ten words had been
classed as most difficult by some one, and each of the ten
words had been classed as least difficult by some one.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus all the investigations tend to show that teachers
are not able to select words according to their difficulty.
The difficulty can only be found by experimenting with
thousands of children and by laboriously correcting and
tabulating the results. Fortunately we have a number
of such investigations, so that the assignment of words to
a certain grade need not be wholly dependent upon the
judgment of an individual teacher, but upon the results
obtained from testing thousands of children by a number
of different skilled investigators.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Selection of a Vocabulary through Investigation</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>A most important investigation of the vocabularies of
children has been made by Dr. W. Franklin Jones of the
University of South Dakota. Dr. Jones studied 75,000
themes written by children of all grades from the second to
the eighth inclusive, gathered from three different states,
and averaging a little less than 190 words each. The number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>of themes per student ranged from 56 to 105. The total
number of words amounted to nearly 15,000,000.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the important results of this investigation the
following stand out significantly:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Out of the 15,000,000 words used there were only
4,532 different words used by more than 2% of the
pupils. (<i>5,000 carefully selected words are, therefore, probably
sufficient for pupils to learn in the first eight years of school.</i>)</p>

<p class='c008'>2. The number of words listed per pupil ranged from
431, the smallest vocabulary in the second grade, to 2,812
for the largest vocabulary of an eighth grade pupil. This
does not necessarily mean that 3,000 words are sufficient
for the spelling vocabulary of children in our schools. The
fact that the various investigators disagree to some extent
in the vocabularies which they find, is enough to prove this
point. There are many factors, such as home conditions,
nationality, and locality, which may affect the number of
words that will be used. However, when the number is
increased to approximately twice the largest single vocabulary
found, all of the common words of the best investigations
will have been included.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The average number of words in the written vocabulary
of each grade is as follows:</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>

    <td class='c011'>Grade 2</td>
    <td class='c012'>521</td>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>When Should Spelling Be Taught</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The scientific teaching of spelling requires that words
shall be taught in the grade in which they are first used.
When the child first enters school his speaking vocabulary
is comparatively large. His reading vocabulary varies from
nothing to one fairly large, depending, in part, on the home
from which the child comes. His writing vocabulary is
very limited, even under the best of conditions. This
latter increases very rapidly during the first three years.
The teaching of nearly 2,000 words in the second grade
becomes, of course, a gigantic, even an impossible, task.
The <span class='sc'>Aldine Speller</span> obviates this in two ways:</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) By postponing the teaching of the words least likely
to be used in the second grade until a later grade.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>(<i>b</i>) Many of the words which should be taught in the
early grades have basic parts which have been called phonograms.
By use of these phonogram groups, or “families,”
the number of words taught in the first and second grades
can be very greatly increased, and the best possible foundation
given for the development of a <i>spelling sense</i>. The
<span class='sc'>Aldine Speller</span> makes full use of this principle, and
a very complete list of phonic “families” will be found at
the close of the work of the second year. (See page 65,
Part I.) Attention is also called to suggestions for teaching
such words on page <a href='#Page_28'>28</a> of this manual.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Other Investigations</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>In 1911 Mr. R. C. Eldridge published the results of a
study of 250 different newspaper articles occurring in four
issues of a Buffalo Sunday paper. Of the 43,098 words
tabulated there were only 6,002 different words. <i>This again
shows that the writing vocabulary even of adults is comparatively
small.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Cook and O’Shea studied the correspondence of thirteen
adults, tabulating 200,000 words, and found only 5,200
different words.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is one underlying characteristic of each of these
three studies; viz., the writing, and therefore the spelling,
vocabulary of individuals is much smaller than we formerly
considered it, and consists of approximately 5,000 words.
(The <span class='sc'>Aldine</span> vocabulary contains approximately 5,000 carefully
selected words which should form the basis of the
writing vocabulary of an eighth grade pupil.)</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>The Construction of a Spelling Scale</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In 1915 Dr. Leonard P. Ayres of the Russell Sage Foundation
tabulated some of the lists of words then available
and made a selection of the 1,000 commonest words. This
list of 1,000 words was then divided into 50 lists of 20 words
each and given in the middle of the year to the children of
two consecutive grades in a number of cities. As a check,
words were taken from each of the fifty lists and recombined
into new sets of twenty words each, then sent out as tests
in each of four consecutive grades in different cities. The
whole number of children thus tested was 70,000 in 84
cities in grades II to VIII inclusive. On the basis of this
testing the Ayres Spelling Scale was organized.</p>

<p class='c008'>The significant features of the scale are: (1) It contains
only the commonest words. (2) It gives approximately
what one ought to expect from any given grade when spelling
words that are listed as equal in spelling difficulty. (3) The
determination of the difficulty of any word was not dependent
on the judgment of any one person, or group of persons,
but on the ability of a large group of children to spell those
words by writing them.</p>

<p class='c008'>In giving the tests for the purpose of this scale it was not
previously known whether the words had been studied or
not. It has been found that testing these words after
they have been carefully taught yields from 5% to 20%
higher accuracy. Because they are the most common
words in our language (Ayres found that these words
comprise approximately 90% of our writing vocabulary)
they are the words which ought to be taught carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and thoroughly. All of these words occur in the Aldine
Vocabulary.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>The Boston List</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The Boston Minimum List consists of words selected from
lists that had been sent in by the teachers of the different
grades as the words which, in their opinion, should be
taught in their respective classes. Two hundred and thirty-seven
teachers sent in lists of approximately thirty-five
words each. These words were then arranged in alphabetical
order together with the number of teachers reporting each
word. All words were then arranged in two lists, a minimum
list composed of words which it was considered desirable
for every child to know, and a supplementary list, including
all the other words which had been reported. The words
were at the same time assigned to the grades in which they
were to be taught on the following basis:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. Only those words that were reported by at least
five teachers were placed in the minimum list.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Any given word was placed in the grade in which
it was reported by the largest number of teachers.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. If the spelling of any word depended on a particular
rule or suggestion the word was placed in the grade in
which such a rule or suggestion was given in the course of
study then in force.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a year’s work on the words they were assigned a
value determined by the percentage of children who were
able to spell the word correctly in a carefully controlled
test. This provided a definite problem for the teacher
because it pointed out the easy and the difficult words.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>A word with a high percentage of accuracy was considered
an easy word. A word with a low percentage of accuracy
was considered a difficult word.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Other Lists</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>From time to time during the last few years other lists
of words have been organized, all with the view of conserving
the time given to spelling by requiring the pupil to learn to
spell only those words for which he has an immediate or
a probable future use. There has also been an attempt on
the part of a few of the organizers to determine the difficulty
of the lists as was done in Boston. Such lists have
been organized in St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri, and
in other places, notably in the state of Iowa.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>The Construction of the Aldine Speller</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The vocabulary of the <span class='sc'>Aldine Speller</span> has been
selected with great care. All the important lists were
tabulated in such a way as to show the recurrence of the
words and the grade distribution. Careful testing and
study were given where there were significant variations in
order to determine the correct selection and gradation. In
addition to this the vocabularies of several of the best known
textbooks were tabulated to ascertain the basis, if any, of
their selection of words. These vocabularies varied so
largely as to be of little value except to show the defects
of unscientific selection.</p>

<p class='c008'>Approximately 5,000 words were finally chosen. These
include the words in common use and such words in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>upper grades as are necessary to teach the varying vocabulary
of life by the development of desirable forms.
Without this attention to derivatives, difficult endings, the
error producing problems of <i>ie</i> or <i>ei</i>, and the doubling of the
final consonant, no course in learning to spell is complete
or fully effective.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the selection of the words a series of illustrative
sentences was gathered from many sources. Many of
these sentences are quotations from our best authors, are
within the grasp of the children, and will be found invaluable
for memorizing, as dictation exercises, or used simply to
illustrate the use of the words taught in the previous
lessons.</p>

<p class='c008'>Finally, at the end of the work for each grade, will be
found an alphabetically arranged list of all the words taught
in that grade, with the exception of the phonic words taught
in the first and second grades which are not alphabetically
arranged. The latter will be found, with others of the
same “family,” or series, at the end of Part I.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Types of Learning</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>In the past the method of giving the spelling lesson was
to assign a list of words for pupils to study. After a period
of time the lesson was “recited.” The “recitation” consisted
largely of testing the pupils, either orally or through
written work, to see if they had learned what had been
assigned to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>This method of learning spelling appealed to only one type
of pupil, <i>i.e.</i>, the pupil who learned by <i>seeing</i>. However,
we know now that, although most children depend largely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>upon vision for what they learn, there are those who learn
best by hearing the word <i>spoken</i>, while there are others who
learn best by going through the motions of making the
letters, either with the throat or the hand, and a large majority
learn best by using all four processes.</p>

<p class='c008'>To obtain the best results teachers are urged to give the
pupils a chance to use all four processes, not for the purpose
of testing their ability to spell, but <i>as a method of learning</i>.
In this way appeal is made successively to the eye, the ear,
the vocal organs, and the hand. All these taken together form
associations which will be of great help in enabling the
pupil to retain the correct spelling of the word. It gives
the pupil a mental picture of the word through the sense
that is best suited to him, besides giving all pupils the help
of all the senses in fixing the word.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the sense of hearing holds an important place in learning
to spell then oral spelling becomes an important factor in
the teaching and learning to spell. <i>Oral spelling should
always precede written spelling.</i></p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Written Spelling</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Ability to spell a word means the carrying out of certain
habits which have already been formed. If these habits
are right then the word is spelled correctly. If children
have not formed the right set of habits, if their pronunciation
is wrong, if their mental picture is distorted, if imperfect
vision causes them to see the word indistinctly, if their
hearing is not normal, or if the coördination of the muscles
is poor, any or all of these things will lead to the misspelling
of a word. It is highly important, therefore, that the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>impression which the pupil gets of the word shall be a correct
one. That first impressions are lasting must be continually
kept in mind. <i>The method of teaching</i> will help or hinder
the getting of this correct impression.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pronunciation and Enunciation</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Assuming that every word in the spelling lesson is already
long since in the child’s speaking vocabulary there should be
no word in it that he cannot and does not pronounce correctly.
However, there are some very common words too
often mispronounced. The teacher should watch for these
words and secure a correct pronunciation.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is little chance for a boy to spell “<i>kept</i>” correctly,
if he pronounces the word as though it were
spelled “<i>k-e-p</i>.” In words of more than one syllable the
form should be emphasized by syllabication, thus making
certain that each syllable is pronounced. Of 155 pupils
who misspelled “<i>boundary</i>,” 100, or 64.5% spelled the
word they heard, namely “<i>boundry</i>.” This spelling was
certainly caused by poor pronunciation. Syllabication
makes the spelling more obvious, promotes clear enunciation,
and assists in making a clear mental picture of the word.
If the word is composed of two words, as “somewhere,”
he sees more readily that the long word is only made up of
the two short words with which he is already familiar.
Throughout the book all words of more than one syllable
are so syllabicated when first taught. It is unwise to require
children to divide such words in a written spelling lesson.</p>

<p class='c008'>Much time and much thought may wisely be given to the
enunciation of children. Clear and accurate enunciation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>should <i>always</i> be demanded. Children strongly tend to
spell as they speak. Slovenly enunciation will give inaccurate
spelling.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Root Words and Derived Words</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>There is abundant material throughout the book illustrating
the changes in root words when derivatives are formed.
This does not mean, however, that there is nothing for the
teacher to do. The teacher must keep constantly in mind
that it is not necessarily true that because the child can
spell “health,” he can spell “healthy.” Below is given
a list of twenty-three words and one or more derivatives
which were given to approximately 1,000 children in the
sixth grade. It was known beforehand that the root word
had been taught either during the year or in the fifth grade.
The number following each word indicates the percentage of
accuracy with which each word was spelled. It will be
noted that in each case the root word was spelled with
from 5% to 40% higher accuracy than the derivatives.</p>

<p class='c008'>In every case but one (attacking) the derivative proved
itself a harder word to spell even though it, too, had been
taught. Since it is important that children should know
how to spell such common words as “judges,” “mosquitoes,”
etc., as well as the root word, <i>many derived forms must be
considered as presenting new spelling problems and taught as
such</i>. Since it is impossible to teach all derivatives and the
needs of the pupils are varied, careful training in the formation
of derivatives must be given.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>
  <h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Homophones or Homonyms</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Homophones, or as they are more commonly called,
homonyms, are words spelled differently but pronounced
alike. Throughout the text of this book they have been
purposely kept apart. Investigation strongly points to the
conclusion that they should be kept apart until the correct
spelling has become a fixed habit, and the ability to use them
correctly in sentences reasonably sure. In order that no
confusion as to the proper use of a homophone may arise
in the child’s mind, it should be presented in a phrase,
or still better in a complete sentence. In dictating words
it should never be taken for granted that the child knows
which one of a pair of homophones is meant. A sentence
should be given to show which one is required. Spelling
<i>there</i> correctly in a column of words does not necessarily
mean that the word would be spelled correctly in a sentence.
If the child <i>always</i> hears it in its proper setting there will
be a tendency always to <i>see</i> it in this setting with the correct
spelling naturally following.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Proper Names</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The proper names that should be taught vary with the
community and the school. The teacher should herself
select those that need to be taught to her class. In the first
grade the child should be taught to spell his own name.
In the second grade he should be taught the most common
names of other children in the room, the name of the teacher,
of the city or town, and of the state. He should be taught
that these names always begin with a capital letter. Other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>local names of special importance should be taught at the
discretion of the teacher. In later grades the names that
are needed in Geography and History should be taught
in connection with those subjects.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Use of the Dictionary</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The “dictionary habit” is a most desirable one. Those
children are fortunate who have instant access to a dictionary
when they begin the work in the fourth grade. However,
<i>children must be taught how to use the dictionary</i>. Suggestions
for teaching the use of it may be found in the suggestions
for each grade. (See pages 37, 42, 46, 55, etc.)
Do not deaden the interest by requiring the pupils to look
up every word in the lesson, but rather have them look up
all words whose spelling or pronunciation is uncertain.
Such work may be used very profitably as a language lesson
rather than as a part of the spelling lesson. Many interesting
and helpful lessons may be given in forming plurals, adding
prefixes and suffixes, selecting derivatives, and finding
synonyms other than those given in the book. <i>No lesson
should be assigned in the dictionary before the children have
been taught how to use it.</i> The lessons in this book suggest
how to teach its use and give some practical experience in
consulting it for the pronunciation of words. The resourceful
teacher will find opportunity for much additional
practice.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Rules and their Uses</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The <span class='sc'>Aldine Speller</span> aims to develop a few general
rules for spelling. These are carefully developed throughout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the grades but appear as formal rules only in the later
grades. The foundation of some of the rules is laid in Part
I, and the development continues throughout the succeeding
grades. (See lesson 57, grade III, lesson 74, grade IV,
etc.)</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Review Lists</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Throughout the book, review lists are common. The time
usually allotted to the spelling lesson is short and, therefore,
only those words which have been shown by investigation
to need reviewing occur in these review lists. Words
presenting the most difficulty are often repeated in the same
and succeeding grades. The words which are recurring
constantly in the written vocabulary of children are the
words which they need to be sure that they have mastered.
Including only such words for review will enable both teacher
and pupil to conserve the time of the school day. The
lessons are short and it is expected that each word is to be
carefully taught the first time. If this is done and the pupil’s
list of the misspelled words is kept, the need of long reviews
will be minimized.</p>

<p class='c008'>Other lists in the form of reviews consist of groups of
words especially alluded to by other authors. For example,
at the close of the work of the third grade will be found the
hundred commonest words in the English language. Ayres
points out that these words with their repetitions constitute
about one-half of all the words we write. There is no
question about the need of thoroughly mastering them
early. On pages 42 and 43 of the fifth year work and pages
84 and 85 of the sixth year will be found lists of words taken
from the 1,000 commonest words of the English language.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>At the end of other grades will be found lists of known
trouble makers which should be carefully reviewed.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Use of Vocabulary</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>At the end of the work for each grade, the list of the
words taught in the grade is given. If the word is taught in
any previous grade an asterisk is placed before the word.
For example, <i>which</i> appears in the vocabulary of grade VI
in this manner: *&nbsp;which. This shows that <i>which</i> has been
taught in a previous grade but does not tell in what grades,
nor how many times it occurs in each grade. It is given in
the vocabulary of grade V in the same manner. In grade
III it occurs without the asterisk, showing that this word
occurs for the first time in grade III.</p>

<p class='c008'>These vocabularies should be of great value to both teacher
and pupil as they will enable both to determine at once
the words which have been taught in the respective grades.
If the word has been taught in a previous grade the teacher
will know it and govern herself accordingly. If the word
has been presented in that grade the pupil has a chance to
find out the spelling without consulting the teacher, thus
saving the teacher’s time.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Phonetic Words</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Many of the words in this book are grouped into phonetic
lists. The object of this is strongly to impress the basic
part of these words upon the child. The repeated sight,
sound, and spelling of this common combination of letters
makes it possible to learn the words in a list easily and in
a short time.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>
  <h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>An Effective Method</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>1. Write <i>one</i> of the words on the blackboard. While
writing the word <i>pronounce</i> it very distinctly by syllables,
being clear in enunciation.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Have the word pronounced in concert by the class and
individually by poor spellers, particularly those whose
enunciation is naturally poor.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Develop the meaning orally by using the word in
a sentence, or defining it.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Rewrite the word dividing it into syllables either by
a slight break or a line. Call on pupils to spell orally by
syllables, as: i-n—d-e—p-e-n-d—e-n-t—independent.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Have pupils indicate familiar parts or phonograms
in the words. Have them point out peculiarities, non-phonetic
elements, silent letters, double consonants, etc.
Call attention to any that they do not observe.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. Have pupils write the word at least two or three times,
pronouncing it softly by syllables, or spelling it silently as
they write.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. After the words of the lesson have been studied in this
way, allow pupils to study the words silently, laying stress
on words which have seemed most difficult to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. Bear in mind the following:</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) A single lesson should consist of a small number of
words. The <span class='sc'>Aldine Speller</span> plans for two or three new
sight words (or five to seven words in a phonic series) for
a lesson in the lower grades, gradually increasing until five
or six new words may be used in a lesson in the upper grades.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) Errors should be anticipated and prevented as far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>as possible. <i>Create a strong impression of the word at the
beginning.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>c</i>) Correct pronunciation, and above all <i>clear enunciation</i>,
should be insisted on at all times.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>d</i>) Writing the word on the board or on paper immediately
after the oral discussion of it gives the “muscle
feel” of the word that is of great importance.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>e</i>) The ancient custom of requiring the writing of words
a number of times as a punishment is a crime.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>f</i>) A weekly test should be given. This should consist of
words taught during the week, of words previously misspelled
by the pupils, of words from the “Demon Books,”
or personal lists of the pupils.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Correction of a Word</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>In the past teachers “corrected” spelling papers solely
for the purpose of determining which words were spelled
incorrectly. The better thought is to examine spelling
papers for the purpose of finding which words are wrong in
order to determine why <i>they are misspelled</i>. This helps the
teacher because it enables her to place the emphasis on the
part of the word which is difficult and tends to prevent
further misspelling. <i>Prevent the misspelling of a word at
the beginning. Form right habits of spelling rather than
attempt to correct bad habits of spelling</i>, should be the slogan
of every teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>In correcting spelling it should be borne in mind that
some words have more than one correct spelling. The
child’s spelling should not be called incorrect if it is an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>approved form. Call his attention to the preferred form,
telling him why it is preferred.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Pupil Lists</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>One method of bringing about this formation of good
habits is to have each pupil keep a list of his <i>own</i> “demons.”
Each pupil’s list will be different, for many words are
“demons” for one pupil but not for another. This list
may include root words and derivatives, or only derivative
words. Each pupil should be required to keep his own list
on which he, personally, may be tested from time to time
to see if he has mastered the words that have proved difficult
for him to learn. This list should not include the words
that have been misspelled accidentally.</p>

<p class='c008'>Writing misspelled lists as a punishment should <i>be
absolutely forbidden</i>.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SUGGESTIONS FOR FIRST YEAR</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Alphabet</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Often the spelling of words is forced upon the child before
he has properly mastered the alphabet. This is the cause
of much poor spelling, much <i>guessing</i> in the primary grades.
Before a child is allowed to spell orally he should be absolutely
sure of the name of every letter, and he should be able
to recognize and name it at sight. Before he is allowed to
write one word in a dictated spelling lesson, the pupil should
be able to write any letter of the alphabet from dictation.
This means that the real study of spelling should not be
undertaken until the middle of the first year or later.</p>

<p class='c008'>Be sure that your pupils know their letters before beginning
spelling. Following are some suggestions for alphabet
drills. Use any that you think helpful.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Alphabet Drills</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>1. Have pupils read the alphabet in order, pointing to
each letter as it is named.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Have pupils point to the letters in any order as you
call them.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this drill teach them the approximate place of the
letters, that is, to look for <i>a</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>f</i>, near the beginning; <i>j</i>,
<i>n</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>o</i>, near the middle; <i>t</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>w</i>, near the end.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>3. Ask such questions as, “What letter comes after <i>m</i>?
<i>n</i>? <i>d</i>? <i>t</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Consonant Drills.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) Call a letter and have pupils give the sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) Sound a letter and have pupils give the name.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Written Work.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) Have pupils copy the alphabet in script from print.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) Have pupils write the alphabet from memory.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>c</i>) Dictate the letters in any order and require the pupils
to write them. Time the children in this exercise, encouraging
them to write as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. The Typewriter Game.</p>

<p class='c008'>Call the alphabet on page 7 of the child’s book the keys
of a typewriter. Have the children spell words, touching
the letters as the letter keys. Dictate as follows: “Write
<i>at</i> on your typewriter.” The pupils touch <i>a</i> and <i>t</i> as they
spell aloud. Then dictate <i>cat</i>, <i>bat</i>, <i>hat</i>. Use phonetic
words or words made of letters near together in the alphabet.
The object of the exercise is to find quickly the place of
each letter in the alphabet, as well as to give the ability to
quickly recognize the letters.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>A Phonetic List</span></h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>Lesson 1, Page 8</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>As may be seen at a glance, this lesson contains five words
using the phonogram <i>un</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The directions and suggestions given below for the study
of this particular lesson apply to all similar phonetic lessons
in the book.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>1. Pronounce each word distinctly, giving its meaning
or using it in a sentence, as, “sun—The sun is shining
brightly.” You thus give the children the word properly
used and leave in no pupil’s mind the idea that you meant
<i>son</i>. “Fun—Did you have fun at recess time, Tom?”
Tom’s recollection of the recess games will associate the
word and its meaning. “Gun—Who has seen a gun?
What is its use? Bun—The baker puts currants in the
bun.” By the variety of ways in which you give or suggest
the meaning of the word, try to arouse the pupil’s
interest in the word itself. Never require a pupil to study
the spelling of a word until he has heard it properly pronounced
and knows the meaning.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Have the pupils read the words, pronouncing each
correctly. The children may give original sentences, using
the new words.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Pupils pronounce and spell each word orally.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Ask what letters are found in every word. Teach the
children to call the common part the “family name” of
the word and to spell it as a unit, as, “sun—spell, s-<i>un</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Tell the children to look at the list of words and choose
the hardest. They may look at the word for a moment,
then spell it without looking at the book. In some such
way arouse interest in the spelling of each word in the lesson,
as, “Who can find and spell the word that is the name of
something that makes a great noise?” “The one we all
enjoy at recess?” “The one that opens the flowers?”
“The one we like to eat?”</p>

<p class='c008'>6. Pronounce each word, give the family, and spell the
word thus, sun,&nbsp;-un, s-u-n. Have pupils emphasize the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>letter—the part of each word that is not common to the
series—as, <i>s</i>un, <i>f</i>un, <i>b</i>un, <i>g</i>un, <i>n</i>un.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. Children place their books face down on their desks,
while the teacher dictates the words. Children spell orally.
If a word is missed, do not pass it to another child. The
one who missed turns over his book and studies the correct
spelling while the teacher continues to dictate words to the
other pupils. After all the children have spelled, those who
missed have a chance to spell their words correctly. From
the beginning every child must feel a responsibility for every
word dictated to him. He must spell it correctly before
the lesson is ended for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all oral spelling, save time by having the children respond
in turn without being called upon by name. Perhaps
the best way is to go up and down the rows.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Copying a Spelling Lesson</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Spell the first word very softly and write it on the blackboard
as you pronounce each letter. The children look at
the written form on the board, and copy the word, saying
to themselves each letter as they write. Do the same with
other words.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not necessary to copy each word more than once.
The common part or family name—the combination of
letters that requires special drill—is repeated in each
word.</p>

<p class='c008'>As pupils gain facility in written letter forms, they should
copy their lessons once in script from the printed lesson in
the book. For the first ten lessons, however, the teacher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>may well take the time to have the work copied from the
board.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Dictating a Spelling Lesson</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The teacher who truly means to make her children realize
the importance of accurate spelling and neat writing will
see that each child has a notebook in which to keep his
spelling lessons. She will show him just how the work
should be arranged in his book. (The child’s spelling book
shows a good arrangement.) She will insist that he follow
the arrangement and that his penmanship be neat. If the
teacher cannot provide regular blank books for spelling, the
children may make their own of regular writing paper,
fastening the requisite number of sheets together with two
Magill fasteners, or sewing them with thread or raffia.</p>

<p class='c008'>In dictating, pronounce each word clearly and distinctly.
Have the children repeat, then write the word. This habit
of correct pronunciation of the words cannot be overemphasized.
It has been said, and the saying is true, “A
word correctly pronounced is half spelled.”</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Marking and Correcting Papers</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>When a lesson is perfect, mark it. Mark it <i>perfect</i>. That
is the mark primary children like best. Mark it in colored
pencil. If the child has made a special effort in writing or
in neatness, show your appreciation and observation by affixing
a star or some other symbol to his paper. Encourage
him, make him proud of his spelling, proud of his writing,
proud of his book, proud of himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Give no spelling mark but the mark for perfect work.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>When a child makes a mistake in spelling, call his attention
to it. If it is only a careless mistake, he will spell the
word orally. The <i>teacher</i> then erases the mistake, and the
child corrects it. If, however, the child has not mastered
the correct spelling, he should be referred to his book.
When he can spell the word, the teacher erases the incorrectly
spelled word, and the child writes it correctly.</p>

<p class='c008'>The correcting of the lesson should follow as soon as possible
the writing of the lesson. In order that this may be
done in the same period, the lessons are kept very short.
In order that there may be few mistakes the lessons are very
simple. If the lessons are studied as suggested, there should
be very few errors to correct. If the work is corrected as
definitely as outlined, the pupils will soon learn what is
required of them, and will take pride in having a perfect,
attractive book. The arousing of such pride, and the cultivation
of habits of correctness and neatness are of incalculable
value.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. By thoughtful, intelligent study, prevent errors.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. When mistakes are made, have the pupils correct
them immediately as an important duty.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Sight Words</span></h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c003'>
    <div>Lesson 3, Page 8</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The children have had two series or families in past
lessons. In the new lesson ask them to look for words that
belong to these families. They will find <i>run</i> in the <i>un</i>
family, and <i>me</i>, <i>the</i>, <i>tree</i>, in the <i>e</i> (<i>ee</i>) family. These words
should be distinctly pronounced and spelled orally.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>The remaining word is <i>to</i>. It belongs to no family that
the children have studied. Have the children pronounce it,
use it in a number of simple sentences, and spell it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Give each child a small piece of paper. Tell the children
to look at <i>to</i> and spell it silently. Then without looking at
the book have them write the word on paper. Each word
in the lesson may be studied and written in the same way.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Writing Sentences</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>No new spelling words occur in this lesson. It is a review,
an application of some of the words learned.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first lesson, and perhaps a few others of the same
kind, should be taught from the board, although it is better
that each child should have a book before him.</p>

<p class='c008'>A child reads the first sentence from the book. “Run to
me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher says, “I will write it on the board if you will
spell the words. The children in the first row stand.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Without waiting to be called upon by name the children
spell the words in turn.</p>

<p class='c008'>The teacher says, “<i>Run</i> begins with a capital letter because
it is the first word in a sentence. Spell it, capital
R-u-n.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When all the words in the sentence have been spelled and
written on the board, the teacher places the period at the
end, saying, “There is a period at the end of this sentence.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The second sentence is to be spelled by the children and
written on the board by the teacher in the same way.</p>

<p class='c008'>The children may now copy the sentences from the blackboard.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>The two things to be taught in this lesson are the capital
to begin the first word, and the period at the end of the
sentence.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Reviews of Phonetic Words</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Phonetic reviews are given frequently throughout the
book. Each lesson contains one word of the series taught.
These words are numbered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Have the children open their books to the review lesson,
as that on page 12.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let the children read the words and the families, as, <i>run-un</i>,
<i>me-e</i>, <i>play-ay</i>, <i>fly-y</i>. Then have each word spelled
orally.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now dictate other words from the same families, <i>as</i>, <i>sun</i>,
<i>see</i>, <i>gay</i>, <i>cry</i>, <i>sand</i>. If a pupil misspells a word, give him
the number of the family in which the word occurs. Let
him look in his book, study his word, and be ready to spell
it when you have finished dictating other words to the rest
of the class. Thus you may dictate the word <i>say</i>. The
child hesitates or misspells the word. Give him number
<i>3</i>. He looks in his book, finds <i>3</i> and the well-known
word <i>play</i> after the number. He knows the word <i>say</i>
is in the same family, and he studies out the word while
you are hearing the rest of the class spell words in the other
families. When you return to him and ask, “What is your
word?” he answers, “Say—s-a-y.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Never pass a word to a second child. Each child must
spell, with help if necessary, every word that is dictated to
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>For written review, dictate any words from the series
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>represented in the review lesson. Return again and again
to these review lessons.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Seat Work</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Have the children copy the words and under each write
one or more words in the same family. Thus:</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>run</td>
    <td class='c014'>me</td>
    <td class='c014'>play</td>

    <td class='c018'>and</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>fun</td>
    <td class='c014'>be</td>
    <td class='c014'>hay</td>
    <td class='c014'>try</td>
    <td class='c018'>band</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Reviews of Sight Words</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Use these reviews for oral spelling matches and for written
tests. Keep records of these written tests. There are 36
sight words assigned to the first year. Arouse the child’s
interest and ambition to master these words by encouragement
and all good incentives.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Additional Seat Work</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>1. Make the words or sentences in each lesson with
“word builder” letters. This work should be carefully
examined to see that it is correct and that it follows the
arrangement given in the book.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Copy in script the lesson from the book.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SUGGESTIONS FOR SECOND YEAR</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Review</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The work of the second grade is a continuation of the
work begun in the first grade. It will be well, therefore, for
the second grade teacher to read carefully the suggestions
given for the work of the first grade. Although some of the
words that have already been taught in the first grade occur
in the second grade, the first work of the second grade
teacher will be to carefully review the phonograms and
sight words already taught. This will help to sift out the
words which need special emphasis and will form the beginning
of the word lists which the children are urged to keep.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Phonograms</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The phonograms are continued in the second grade and
the same emphasis on the common part as outlined in the
suggestions for the first grade should be continued. (See

<p class='c008'>Have the children copy these sentences, telling them that
the quotation marks are put around “Where are my baby
stars?” because these are the words of the moon. If

<p class='c008'>In addition to teaching the use of a capital at the beginning
of a sentence, the names of five of the months of the year are
given in Lesson 50, and a proper name is introduced into
Lesson 56. Here is a chance to emphasize that the names
of the months, and the names of people, always begin with
a capital letter no matter where they occur in the sentence.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Dictionary Preparation</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>1. The order of the letters should be thoroughly familiar
at this time. If not, it must be made so. (See suggestions
for drill on page <a href='#Page_27'>27</a>.)</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Have the pupils read clearly and distinctly the words
in any lesson,—as, for example, Lesson 1, page 25,—telling
the first letter in each, saying, “The first letter in <i>moon</i> is
<i>m</i>; the first letter in <i>soon</i> is <i>s</i>; the first letter in <i>noon</i> is
<i>n</i>; the first letter in <i>spoon</i> is <i>s</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Have the pupils group words that begin with the same
letter, as, Lessons 1, 2, and 3. Teacher says, “Find all
the words in these three lessons that begin with <i>s</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Teacher: Find the words that begin with <i>b</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pupils: <i>Bid</i> and <i>bar</i> begin with <i>b</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Later the pupils may make a list of all the words on a page
beginning with the same letter.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Have the pupils copy in a column all the words in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>lesson, or in several lessons, or on a page, that begin with
the same letter. This should be done under definite direction
of the teacher, as, “Make a list of all the words on page
25 that begin with <i>b</i>; with <i>c</i>; with <i>d</i>; with <i>f</i>.” Pupils
write as follows:</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>

</table>

<p class='c008'>5. Turn to the vocabulary of second year words (page
63). Have the pupils observe that they are arranged in
alphabetical order.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) Pupils find the place in the list of words beginning
with any given letter, thus:</p>

<p class='c008'>Teacher: Where must we look for words beginning with
<i>a</i>?</p>

<p class='c008'>Pupils: At the beginning, for <i>a</i> is the first letter in the
alphabet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Teacher: Where must we look for words beginning
with <i>w</i>?</p>

<p class='c008'>Pupils: Near the end, for <i>w</i> is near the end of the
alphabet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Teacher: Where must we look for words beginning with
<i>m</i>?</p>

<p class='c008'>Pupils: Near the middle, for <i>m</i> is near the middle of the
alphabet.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) Pupils find any word called for in the list. Teacher
asks, “Where shall I find <i>barn</i>?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Pupils answer, “With words beginning with <i>b</i>, near the
beginning.” Pupils find the word and touch it. In the
same way the teacher calls for other words. In each case
the pupils decide where in the list to look for it according to
the initial letter, then find and touch it.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>c</i>) Let the pupils go through the list to see if every letter
in the alphabet has been used as an initial letter. They
will find that there are no words listed beginning with <i>q</i>,
<i>x</i>, and <i>z</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>d</i>) Have the pupils write the alphabet in vertical columns
omitting <i>q</i>, <i>x</i>, and <i>z</i>, and opposite each letter copy a word
beginning with that letter from their lists on pages 63 and
64, thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>a—after</div>
      <div class='line'>b—baby</div>
      <div class='line'>c—children</div>
      <div class='line'>d—dog</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Initial Words of Phonetic Series</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>On pages 61 and 62, the teacher will find a list of initial
words of the phonetic series that have been taught in the
first two grades in the order in which they have been taught.
This list will provide a means for the teacher to learn
whether a series has been taught, and the relative position
of the series in the work of the first two grades.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Vocabulary</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The vocabulary on pages 63 and 64 gives a complete list
of all the sight words which have been taught in the first
and second grades. It will furnish the teacher the means:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>1. For finding if any given word is to be found in the
text of the first two grades.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. For excellent drill in preparation for the use of the
dictionary.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. For a review list at the end of the year’s work.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Phonic Series</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The phonic series used in this book are presented first in
the text as short lists. On page 65, Part I, will be found
more complete lists for supplementary drill, if desired.
These are numbered in the same order and are similar
to those found on the Aldine Phonic Chart. If one of
these charts is available, it will be found of great assistance
in the teaching of spelling in these early grades.
Drills on these complete series may well be given whenever
a review or an additional lesson is possible. The pupil may
study from his book, quick drills may be given from the
chart, and then a selected list may be dictated by the teacher.
Too much <i>intelligent</i> drill on these phonic series cannot be
given.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SUGGESTIONS FOR THIRD YEAR</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Use of Stories</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>That stories have helped in other branches of the curriculum
outside of spelling is a well-known fact. Up to the
present, spelling has been so stereotyped, so humdrum, that
stories have had little or no place in the spelling lesson.
Spelling, however, is the result of forming right habits and
these right habits can be stimulated and encouraged by the
right kind of stories. At the beginning of the work of the
third grade is told the story of “The King’s Rules.” This
story should be told to the children along with other stories
of the grade, dramatized, and every means used to fix the
point of the story. During the year constant reference
should be made to “The King’s Rules.” For example,
in teaching Lesson 91 reference should be made to the
king’s second rule. In Lessons 92 and 94 reference should
be made to the king’s third rule. Whenever a pupil mispronounces
a word his attention should be directed to the
first two rules. Care should be exercised in referring to
these three rules that the interest is quickened and not
deadened by the constant repetition and reference to the
same story.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Use of Pictures</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Throughout the book illustrations are given. The words
of a lesson will be found to be illustrated in the pictures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>connected with the lesson. Pupils may be asked to cover
the words of a lesson and write all the words that they find
connected with the picture.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Phonetic Words</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The third grade work continues the work in phonics
started in the first and second grades. The suggestions
given on pages 28 and 36, for the first and second year’s
work, apply equally well to the work of the third year.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Quotations</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The sentences used in connection with the lessons may
be used in a variety of ways:</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) They are placed in the book primarily for the purpose
of illustrating the use of the word.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) They have been very carefully selected from our best
authors and many of them may wisely be memorized.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>c</i>) They may be used as dictation exercises. In this
case misspelled words should be counted as errors. All
other mistakes should be corrected by referring to the book
but should not be counted against the child as an error in
spelling.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Suggestions for Study</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>At the end of many lessons, or groups of lessons, will be
found suggestions for the pupils to use in their study. The
teacher should call attention to these. They will be of
great help to the pupil if he has been taught how to use
them. They are, however, incomplete owing to the lack
of space, and the wise teacher will find other suggestions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>to give the pupils as she finds, through the correcting
of papers, other difficulties which arise in the spelling of
particular words.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Abbreviations</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The use of the capital letter has been presented in connection
with the beginning of the sentence, and the spelling
of the names of the months and of proper names. In the
third grade the names of the days have been added, and a few
abbreviations. (See Lessons 100, 101, 114, 115, 124, etc.)
These should be thoroughly taught with emphasis on the
use of the period.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Preparation for Dictionary Work</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>1. Early in the year have the pupils arrange the words
in any lesson, lessons, or on a page, in alphabetical order;
as, Lessons 22–25, page 15. Pupils write as follows:</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <th class='c019'>A.</th>
    <th class='c019'>B</th>
    <th class='c019'>C</th>
    <th class='c019'>D</th>
    <th class='c018'>&nbsp;</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>around</td>
    <td class='c014'>bowl</td>
    <td class='c014'>clean</td>
    <td class='c014'>dash</td>
    <td class='c018'>etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c014'>beside</td>
    <td class='c014'>cash</td>
    <td class='c014'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c018'>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c014'>bottom</td>
    <td class='c014'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c014'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c018'>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c014'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c014'>bean</td>
    <td class='c014'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c014'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c018'>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c008'>2. Have the pupils turn to the third grade vocabulary,
page 43.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>a</i>) Have them make an alphabetical list of words from
the vocabulary; as, <i>able</i>, <i>beam</i>, <i>cage</i>, <i>daily</i>, etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) <i>Finding Words Quickly.</i> Teacher says, “Read this
list of words until you find the word <i>cane</i>.” After the pupils
have complied the teacher says, “Count all the words you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>read before you found the word <i>cane</i>.” Pupils count and
answer, “Seventy-one.” Teacher asks, “How could I
have saved time in finding this word?” The pupils easily
discover the fact that they can save time by looking for the
word among the words beginning with the same letter. The
teacher tests and proves this to be true by calling for other
words; as, “With what letter does <i>face</i> begin? Where
shall we find it?” Pupils answer, “<i>Face</i> begins with <i>f</i>;
we shall find it with the words beginning with <i>f</i>.” They do
so. Teacher asks, “How many words did you have to read
before finding the word <i>face</i>? How many do you think
you would have to read if you counted from the beginning?”
Conclusion to be discovered and expressed by the pupils:
An alphabetical arrangement of words saves time in finding
any particular word.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>c</i>) <i>Finding Words Easily.</i> Teacher says, “Who can find
the word <i>autumn</i> first?” Pupils find it. Teacher asks the
first pupil ready with the word, “Where did you find it?”
Pupil answers, “I found it among the words beginning with
<i>a</i> at the beginning of the list.” Teacher calls for more
words from different parts of the list; as, <i>farm</i>, <i>yellow</i>, <i>branch</i>,
<i>taste</i>, <i>many</i>, etc. In every case pupils must determine
first, the initial letter of the word; second, the place
in the alphabetical list for words beginning with that
letter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Conclusion to be discovered and expressed: An alphabetical
arrangement of words makes it easier to find any
given word in a given list.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. Have the pupils arrange the hundred words on pages
41 and 42 in alphabetical order, considering only the initial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>letter of each word. This may be done by having each word
copied on an oblong piece of paper, or on oak tag cards, and
these cards placed in alphabetical order, or by having
columns marked off, headed by letters alphabetically
arranged; as:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>A    B    C    D    E    F    G</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>4. (<i>a</i>) Have the children list the words from sentences
or short stories in alphabetical order, as those in “The
Golden Eggs,” page 17.</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>b</i>) After the list has been made (see <i>a</i> above) have the
pupils read through the sentences again to make sure that
every word in them has been listed. The exercise emphasizes
the value of alphabetical arrangement. Example:
Teacher says, “If you wish to make sure that you have the
word <i>the</i> on your list, how can you find out easily and
quickly?” Pupil answers, “I will look near the end of my
list among the words beginning with <i>t</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>(<i>c</i>) <i>Adding to an Alphabetical List of Words.</i> Teacher
says, “I would like to have the word <i>do</i> added to the list.
(See (<i>a</i>) above.) Where should it be written?” Pupil
answers, “Put it with <i>day</i> because it begins with <i>d</i>.” The
teacher says, “There is no word beginning with <i>i</i> in the list;
if I wish to add the word <i>into</i>, where shall I place it?”
Pupil answers, “Place it after the words beginning with <i>h</i>
(or before the words beginning with <i>j</i>) because that is the
place of <i>i</i> in the alphabet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Have the pupils arrange themselves in a line in alphabetical
order, considering first the initial letter of their first
names. Have the pupils take their places as the teacher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>calls the letters. Thus, the teacher calls <i>a</i>, and Alice,
Andrew, and Anna step into line. At once the question
arises as to who shall stand first—all names begin with <i>a</i>.
Teacher writes the names on the board and says, “Look at
the second letter in each name.” The pupils study the
second letter with the teacher, and decide that as <i>l</i>, the
second letter in Alice, comes before <i>n</i>, the second letter in
Anna and Andrew, Alice should have first place. To
fix the place of Andrew and Anna the third letters of each
name must be considered.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. On page 29 is a lesson on arranging by the second letter.
Following this have the pupils arrange other lists of words
in alphabetical order, (<i>a</i>) considering the first two letters
of the word; (<i>b</i>) considering the first three letters.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. Have the children give all the reasons that they can
think of to prove that the alphabetical arrangement of a list
of words is a good one.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SUGGESTIONS FOR FOURTH YEAR</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>How to Study Spelling</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>When the pupil enters the fourth grade he begins to learn
to depend more and more upon himself. He does more
of his work by himself. This is as it should be, but there is
still need of a guiding hand. If the pupil is to acquire
a real <i>spelling consciousness</i>, and form a good habit which is
real and lasting, these helps must be plentiful, but at the
same time arise in such a way that they will be helpful in
forming and strengthening the good habits, and tend to
break any bad habits which may have been started.</p>

<p class='c008'>The suggestions accompanying the lessons in the first
three grades are continued in the fourth, in such a way that,
with the preparation which the pupil has had in the early
grades, he can apply the helps himself with the minimum
amount of care and watchfulness on the part of the teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>As pointed out in Part I of the manual, page <a href='#Page_18'>18</a>, the
derived form in most cases presents a new spelling problem
even though the root word has been taught. By focusing
the attention on the part common to both the root word
and the derivative, and fixing the change by numerous
examples, the change from root to derivative is made with
less trouble. Lessons 4, 5, 15, 16, and 74 illustrate this
point.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>
  <h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Dictionary Work</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>During the previous three years the pupils have been
prepared to use the dictionary. They have been made
thoroughly familiar with the alphabet, and are familiar
with the arrangement of words in alphabetical lists. They
have learned to arrange words in alphabetical lists, as
well as to find words easily in a short list which is alphabetically
arranged. The work of the fourth year is the
teaching of the formal use of the dictionary. The following
story is presented as an interesting way of approach. Let
us attempt to vitalize our work in the dictionary. The
place to begin this vitalizing is in the fourth grade. A
“story with a hint in it” for fourth grade teachers is a
suggestion along this line.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>A “Story with a Hint in It” for Fourth Grade Teachers</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The Third Graders had been promoted into the Fourth
Grade! They sat very tall and behaved just like Fourth
Graders as Miss Merlin, their new teacher, said pleasantly:
“This morning as I rode to school in the street car, I read
over the market advertisements. I found in one a word
that is new to me. I don’t know how to pronounce it,
and I don’t know what it means. I will write it on the
board. Perhaps some one may know the word and tell me
how to pronounce it and what it means.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Merlin wrote the word on the board—<i>broccoli</i>—then
turned to the pupils and said, “Can any one pronounce
this word?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Alice stood by her desk ready to speak. “Have you
seen this word before, Alice?” asked Miss Merlin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” answered Alice, “but I think I can guess how it is
pronounced.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh!” said Miss Merlin, “I don’t want any guessing.
You might guess wrong. If I hear the word incorrectly
pronounced for the first time, I am afraid I shall find it
harder to learn the correct pronunciation. Two reasons
why so many words are pronounced incorrectly are: people
guess a wrong pronunciation instead of finding the correct
one; and people hear the incorrect pronunciation instead
of the right one. I want the correct pronunciation for the
word on the board. If you cannot give it to me, perhaps
you can tell me where I can get it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>John jumped to his feet. “Go ask the market man,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I might,” answered Miss Merlin, “but there are reasons
why I would rather not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“It’s too far to the market,” “It would take too long,”
“You can’t go until after school and by then the market
may be closed,” were some of the objections made by the
pupils.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Those are all good reasons,” answered Miss Merlin,
“but if there were no other way to learn the correct pronunciation
of the word I might manage somehow to make
a trip to the market. And I really need not take the trouble.
I can find out all I want to know about that word right
here in our own schoolroom.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The pupils looked at one another with troubled faces.
In the third grade they had always gone to their teacher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>with bothersome words, and here was Miss Merlin bringing
hard words to them and expecting them to help her to learn
the pronunciation and the meaning. Never had they felt
so helpless. Suddenly John cried out, “Oh, I know! The
dictionary!” and running to the front of the room, he placed
his hand on a great, heavy book that lay on the small table
near Miss Merlin’s desk. “My father has a dictionary
like this,” he continued, “and he often looks up words in
it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good, John!” said Miss Merlin, “you have shown me
the best place to go for the help I need. This book contains
400,000 words. My word is one of those 400,000. How
can I find my one word among so many?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I know,” answered John. “My father showed me.
The words are arranged like the alphabet, first the <i>a</i>’s, then,
the <i>b</i>’s, and then the <i>c</i>’s, and so on.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“John is right,” said Miss Merlin. “If you will all come
forward and stand near the table I will show you just as
John’s father showed him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The pupils came forward and Miss Merlin showed them
that the dictionary words were arranged in alphabetical
order. “Now where shall I look for my word?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pupils glanced at the word on the board and answered,
“Look among the words beginning with <i>b</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Merlin opened the dictionary and held all the pages
containing words beginning with <i>b</i> between her two hands.
“If I begin with the first word beginning with <i>b</i> and read
each one, it will take me hours,” she said, “but the maker of
the dictionary has so arranged the words that I can find the
word I want in a few seconds. Let us see if we can discover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>just how the words have been arranged to help us find any
one quickly. We have seen that the words are arranged
alphabetically according to the first letter in each. Now
let us look at the second letter in the word beginning
with <i>b</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The pupils watched as the pages were turned over and
discovered that the words were grouped in alphabetical
order according to the second letter in each.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then,” said Miss Merlin, “if I want to find a word
beginning <i>ba</i> where in the list of words beginning with <i>b</i>
shall I look?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look near the beginning,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“If I want one beginning <i>bl</i> where shall I look?” asked
Miss Merlin.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look towards the middle of the list,” answered the
pupils.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I want to find one beginning with <i>br</i>,” said Miss
Merlin, pointing to the word on the board.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look near the end of the list,” said Alice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Merlin found the first word beginning with <i>br</i>.
“Shall I find my word near the beginning of the <i>br</i> list?”
she asked, holding the page toward the pupils.</p>

<p class='c008'>They looked at the page and answered, “No, all the
words on this page begin <i>bra</i> and you want a word beginning
<i>bro</i>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How shall I find my word?” asked Miss Merlin.</p>

<p class='c008'>John turned over the pages slowly while the other pupils
looked on. “Oh,” cried Alice, “the words are arranged
in alphabetical order for the third letter, so you must look
beyond the middle of the list!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Miss Merlin asked Alice to find the first word beginning
with <i>bro</i>. When it was found the children discovered that
the alphabetical arrangement of letters extended to the
fourth and fifth letters and even unto the end.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Some job!” said John, moved by the efficiency of the
arrangement as well as by the bigness of the task. “Now
I know how I can find any word in the dictionary—just
trail the alphabet from the first to the last letter of the word
you are looking for.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Merlin laughed. “I don’t believe that I’ll try to
improve upon your rule, John,” she said. “The Alphabet
Trail is a pretty good one to follow in tracking any word to
its dictionary den.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Following John’s rule, the word sought—<i>broccoli</i>—was
soon found. “So that you may all see exactly how the
dictionary helps us pronounce this word, I will copy on the
blackboard exactly what I find written here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Stepping to the board, Miss Merlin copied the word,
divided into syllables and marked exactly as it appeared
in the dictionary—(brǒk´ō-lǐ).</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of the pupils understood the diacritical marks for
the short sounds of <i>o</i> and <i>i</i>; others did not. None knew
the meaning of the mark above the <i>o</i> of the second syllable.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said Miss Merlin, “let us see how the dictionary
is ready to help us. Look at the words written at the
bottom of the page. They are all little words that you
know. What letter is marked in the first eight words?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The pupils near enough the dictionary to read replied,
“The letter <i>a</i>.” “And,” added Mary, “each <i>a</i> is marked
in a different way.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“Read the words with the marked <i>a</i>’s and see if you can
discover the reason why each <i>a</i> has a different mark,” said
Miss Merlin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mary read the words, pronouncing each clearly and
distinctly. When she had finished every child was ready
to answer; but Miss Merlin smiled at Mary, who said,
“The <i>a</i> in each word has a sound different from all the
other <i>a</i>’s.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the same way the pupils discovered the different sounds
of <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>u</i>. “Those are all the vowel sounds,” said
Alice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” added John, “and the dictionary man has arranged
them in alphabetical order. Didn’t he stick close to the
alphabet though!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“These little words at the bottom of the page are called
key words,” said Miss Merlin. “Can any one tell why?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The pupils thought for a moment. Then Tom said,
“I know. Because they unlock the pronunciation of the
new word.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good,” said Miss Merlin, “pronounce the first syllable
in our new word on the board, Tom, using the key word.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Tom looked at the mark over the <i>o</i> in the first syllable,
found the same mark over the <i>o</i> in <i>odd</i>, the key word at the
bottom of the page, and said, “Odd—ǒ—brǒk.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good!” said Miss Merlin. “That’s the way. Now,
Jack, pronounce the second syllable.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Jack looked at the mark over <i>o</i>, the only letter in the
second syllable, found the same mark over the <i>o</i> in the
key word <i>obey</i> at the bottom of the page, and said,
“Obey—ō.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>In the same way Alice studied the last syllable, finding
a mark like the one used over the <i>i</i> in the key word <i>ill</i> at
the bottom of the page and said very clearly, “Ill—ĭ—lĭ.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fine!” said Miss Merlin. “John, you may pronounce
the whole word.” John did so, sounding the letters correctly
but placing the accent on the second syllable, thus,
“Brok-o´-li.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not quite right,” said Miss Merlin. “I am going to
pronounce the word correctly. As I speak it notice which
syllable I accent or emphasize.” She then repeated the
word, placing the accent correctly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You accented the first syllable,” said Alice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes,” answered Miss Merlin, “I did. Now look at the
word as I have copied it on the board from the dictionary
and see if you can discover anything that tells me which
syllable should be accented.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I know,” cried John. “There is a little mark
something like a slanting exclamation mark after the first
syllable! Is that why you read it like an exclamation, Miss
Merlin?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Miss Merlin laughed and answered, “Well, we call the
mark an accent. But it is something like an exclamation
mark in looks, and an accented syllable sounds not unlike
an exclamation, John. Now pronounce the word
correctly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>John did so, and then other pupils repeated it after him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now I know how to pronounce the new word but I
don’t know what it means,” said Miss Merlin. “The
meaning of the word is written right after the correct pronunciation.
Mary, will you read what is written?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Mary looked at the printed page for a moment, then read
aloud, “Broccoli. A hardy cauliflower.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“How many know what a cauliflower is?” asked Miss
Merlin. She looked at the upraised hands and added,
“I see that you all know, but if any one didn’t know how
could he find out from the dictionary?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Eagerly the pupils told Miss Merlin how to find the
word—“track it down,” John said—in the dictionary;
how to learn to pronounce it; and how to find the meaning.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good,” said Miss Merlin. “What have you learned in
this lesson?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have learned that I can find the pronunciation and
meaning of any new word in the dictionary,” said Alice.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have learned how to find any word I want,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have learned how to unlock the pronunciation of any
word with the keys at the bottom of the page,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have learned how to accent the right syllable,” said
Mary.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have learned where to look for the meaning of a word,”
said Henry.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then you have learned almost all that is necessary for
a helpful use of the dictionary,” said Miss Merlin. “Tomorrow
we will have some dictionary practice.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The teacher may read the above story to her pupils or
make a similar introductory study of the dictionary with
any word she may select.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SUGGESTIONS FOR FIFTH YEAR</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Use of Story</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>At the beginning of Part II, the story of “The King’s
Rules” was given to the children. This story should be
reviewed for it emphasizes three important factors in
learning to spell.</p>

<p class='c008'>1. To <i>listen</i> carefully when the word is spoken.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. To <i>say</i> it correctly when you speak it.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. To <i>look</i> at the word thoughtfully to get an exact
picture of it in your mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>The work of the fifth and sixth grades opens with another
story to emphasize the same three points in a different way.
The story of “The Two Scouts” emphasizes the fact that a
good speller is a good speller because he</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Sees</i> exactly</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Hears</i> exactly</div>
      <div class='line'><i>Pronounces</i> exactly</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is hoped that fifth and sixth grade teachers will continually
emphasize these three fundamental principles.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Dictionary Work</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The new work of grade IV consisted in the presentation
of the formal use of the dictionary. Many drill lessons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>were given in connection with language, reading, and spelling
lessons. A good habit has been started. The children,
however, have not become sufficiently familiar with the
dictionary to make the finding of words easy. Much
practice in searching for words needs to be given so that
such searching becomes more or less automatic. They
have little need outside of school to use the dictionary,
and there are many matters which the fourth grade teacher
did not have the time to teach, even if the children had
been prepared for it. To give all the drill that is necessary
without the work becoming a burden which the children will
approach with little or no interest will tax the best ingenuity
of the teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fifth grade teacher, therefore, must continue the good
work begun in the fourth grade. She must attempt to
make the habit more automatic. Children must be taught
that they have a real need for the dictionary. The fourth
grade was taught the use of the long and the short vowels
in the word. The fifth grade completes this work by presenting
the other sounds of the vowels and the use of the
key at the bottom of the page in every dictionary. This
work is presented in Lesson 7. Accompanying this lesson is
a list of words which present some difficulty in pronunciation.
Pupils are asked to look up the pronunciation in the
dictionary. <i>This should be done under the immediate supervision
of the teacher.</i> Directions are given the pupil as
an aid in fixing this phase of the work in the memory, <i>not as
a substitute for the teaching</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Toward the latter part of the year a further phase of the
use of the dictionary is presented. Lesson 145 deals with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>subject of finding the spelling of a word of which the pupil is
not quite sure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Steps in finding the spelling of a word:</p>

  <dl class='dl_2'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>Think carefully how the word might be spelled.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>(<i>a</i>) Note the syllables.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>(<i>b</i>) Note the sound of vowels and consonants in each syllable.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>(<i>c</i>) Note the possibilities to represent each sound.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>Find the word in the dictionary.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>(<i>a</i>) Call attention to the fact that the first two or three letters will 
    approximately locate a short word.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>(<i>b</i>) The first four or five letters will approximately locate nearly every word.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>(<i>c</i>) Every word in the dictionary is arranged in exact alphabetical order.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c008'>Words in Lessons 3, 17, 39, and 40 illustrate a third phase
with the development of root words and derivatives which
will be taught formally in the seventh grade. These lessons
bring together words which have a common root. The
teacher should be continually on the watch for these common
roots and call the attention of the children to them. In
undertaking to develop a spelling consciousness there is
probably nothing that will help so much as this phase of the
work. In <i>agree</i>, <i>agreeable</i>, <i>disagreeable</i>, and <i>agreement</i>,
<i>agree</i> is the common part. Children do not always recognize
this, as shown by the fact that children spell the derivative
with a lower degree of accuracy than they spell the root
word. (See page <a href='#Page_19'>19</a> of this manual.)</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
  <h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Enunciation</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Along with the teaching of the various sounds of the
vowels and consonants should come at this time a strong
effort to impress the need of clear enunciation. Great care
should be taken that a vowel is given its true value, that all
sounds are given, that silent letters are not sounded, and that
the syllabication is correct.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor enunciation is a common source of error. Do not
permit “in” for “ing,” final “ed” to be sounded like “t,”
or “body” to be pronounced “buddy.” Remember that
<i>a word correctly pronounced is half spelled</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Teaching of Rules</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>In the text of the earlier grades, emphasis has been frequently
directed toward the changes in words in forming
plurals and adding suffixes and prefixes. Very little has
been said when the only change has been the adding of
“<i>s</i>.” This regular form causes no great trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the fifth year a few simple rules are presented.
These have been frequently illustrated in earlier grades.
The rules presented are those for which there is frequent use.</p>

<p class='c008'>On pages 14, 17, and 19 the rule for writing derivatives of
words ending in <i>y</i> preceded by a consonant is given with
many illustrations. Throughout the year’s work, however,
these words are occurring. Such words will be found in
Lessons 20, 32, 34, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 50, 59, 91, 114, 115, 156.
On page 28 the rule for writing the plurals of nouns ending in
<i>f</i> or <i>fe</i> is given with illustrations. After these rules are
taught the teacher should take every advantage offered for
fixing the rules.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>
  <h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Spelling Demons</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Spelling demons have been described as words which give
trouble and need to be attacked as the knights of old attacked
and overcame dragons and demons that brought trouble to
mankind.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Lessons 64 to 75 the hundred words described by Dr.
Jones as the Hundred Demons of the English Language are
given. Each of these words has been previously taught,
some of them as early as the second grade. It is very
probable, therefore, that for some children only a few of the
words are “demons,” for a demon conquered is a demon no
longer.</p>

<p class='c008'>These lessons, therefore, should be used as a test to find
out which children need further drill or new presentations of
these difficult words. These words should have been fixed
in previous grades, but if any pupil has <i>not</i> mastered the
word now is the time to attempt to master it. However,
it is individual work, <i>not class work</i>, which is needed.</p>

<p class='c008'>On page 42 have been collected 132 of the 1,000 commonest
words as selected by Ayres. This list should be used in
a similar way. All of these words have been taught. The
method to follow, then, is to test first to see what words, if
any, need to be taught again <i>to the class</i>, and then what
words should be emphasized with individuals.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SUGGESTIONS FOR SIXTH YEAR</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Words Used in the Schoolroom</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>In many courses of study the formal teaching of history
begins in the sixth grade. The spelling work of this grade
gives many lessons directly, or indirectly, connected with
the teaching of history. Lessons 1 to 17, and 104 to 109,
have for their foundation lessons on the flag and government.</p>

<p class='c008'>However, there are always special words in various subjects
of the curriculum which should be learned because
of their use in the school work of the year, rather than for
their general use in the world at large. These words are
not included in the spelling book and should be taught
as supplementary words as occasion requires. This is also
true of local and proper names. Proper names, with very
few exceptions, are not taught in this text. The teacher
should make up a list of such local names as her pupils
need to know, and <i>teach</i> the spelling of any that have spelling
difficulty.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Dictionary Work</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The dictionary work of the sixth year aims to establish
the dictionary habit. Lesson 30 is the beginning of the
use of the synonym, although this word is not used in the
pupil’s text at this point. This lesson should be worked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>out very carefully under the immediate supervision of the
teacher. The formal work on synonyms is presented in
the seventh grade, but this preliminary work is of very great
importance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rule for forming the plurals of nouns ending in <i>o</i>
is given in Lesson 35, and for nouns ending in <i>s</i>, <i>sh</i>, <i>ch</i>,
and <i>x</i>, is given in Lesson 36.</p>

<p class='c008'>On pages 63 and 64 are presented lessons consisting
of words having <i>i</i> before <i>e</i>, or <i>e</i> before <i>i</i>. After teaching
Lessons 45 to 50 inclusive, the words of these lessons should
be reviewed as a whole. Other reviews of them should be
frequent enough to be sure that the rule is fixed in the
child’s mind and is being followed. There is no greater
cause for misspelling than the confusion existing because
of these two combinations of letters. Careful teaching at
this point means much. Lessons 51 to 54, inclusive, are
exceptions to the rule and should be carefully noted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Individual words are constantly occurring which well
illustrate the rules that have been taught. Teachers
should not fail to take advantage of these opportunities
in the teaching part of the lesson.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Building a Vocabulary</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Throughout the book every possible opportunity to
present root words and derivatives together has been
taken. Lessons 6, 8, 9, 13, 20, 30, 55, 67, and many others
illustrate this feature. It was not possible to present derivatives
in all cases, or to present all that might well be
discussed with each root word. A great opportunity for
splendid word building exists in connection with the spelling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>lesson. The resourceful teacher will supply additional
words of this class at every opportunity, calling especial
attention to any changes of form because of the formation
of the derivative. This will mean not only a larger spelling
vocabulary but a larger speaking vocabulary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Teaching synonyms also furnishes a chance to greatly
increase the speaking vocabulary.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Demon and Review Words</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>On page 65 is given another list of “demons” prepared
by the authors. The sixth grade teacher should hold
herself responsible for this list. Keep on urging and testing
until each child has mastered <i>his particular demons</i>.
Remember that they are an individual affair and that no
two pupils have the same difficulties.</p>

<p class='c008'>A special review list of common words is also given on
pages 84 and 85. This list should be tested from time to
time, and a very high percentage of accuracy may reasonably
be expected.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Vocabulary</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The vocabulary at the end of the work for the grade
serves four purposes:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. It shows the teacher all the words which are in the
text.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. It enables the pupil to find the word which has occurred
in the year’s work.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The asterisk shows which words have been previously
taught.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. It gives a list of words with which to test the pupils
at the end of the year’s work.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SUGGESTIONS FOR SEVENTH YEAR</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>The Story</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The work of each book begins with a story intended
to impress the children with the importance of <i>seeing</i> the
word exactly, <i>hearing</i> the word correctly, and <i>pronouncing</i>
the word accurately. “The Efficient Guide” emphasizes
these points together with the necessity of learning to
spell the word correctly the first time. The right use of
the story will help to impress upon the children the fact
that in spelling, as in the industrial world, there is no second
chance. A thing is right or it is wrong.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Roots and Derivatives</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The <span class='sc'>Aldine Speller</span> has emphasized throughout its
text the importance of developing a “spelling consciousness.”
A simple list of words is inadequate to accomplish
this. The work of the seventh grade continues this
development by emphasizing the importance of roots and
derivatives. Teachers have been repeatedly urged to
present all derivatives whenever the root word has been
given. The formal study of roots and derivatives is
a large part of the work of the seventh grade. Emphasis
should always be given to the part which is already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>familiar, at the same time calling attention to any
changes in the vowel or in the consonant through the formation
of the derivative.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Troublesome Endings</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>On page 15 will be found a group of words ending in <i>or</i>,
<i>er</i>, and <i>ar</i>. These should be taught in groups until they are
thoroughly fixed. Mnemonics may help to establish the
correct form. Remind the pupil of the spelling and
pronunciation of <i>authority</i> and he will remember that
<i>author</i> ends in <i>or</i>. Likewise <i>factory</i>, <i>inventory</i>, <i>oratory</i>,
<i>similarity</i>, etc., help to show him the correct spelling of the
shorter word. Following this drill review the entire page.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Synonyms</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Much of the work of the seventh grade consists of a careful
study of synonyms. Spelling is closely correlated with
language and one of the results of good spelling teaching
should be not only an ability to spell common words correctly,
but a normal and continuous growth in the written
and spoken vocabularies of the children. This growth can
be increased very materially by the study of derivatives and
synonyms. This study also furnishes the very best exercises
in the use of the dictionary for which the pupils have
been prepared in preceding grades.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Dictionary Work</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Not only does the work in synonyms in this grade provide
excellent dictionary work, but there are still other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>opportunities for the teacher to give the right kind of
practice in the use of that book. No lessons on antonyms
have been given, but it is an excellent practice to have
pupils look up antonyms as well as synonyms. Many
additional paragraphs may be dictated by the teacher and
the pupils required to look up both synonyms and antonyms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing more wooden or deadening can be conceived
than the practice of requiring the pupils to look up every
word in the dictionary and to write a definition for each
and every one. This monotonous practice should never
be followed. Put life and interest into the lesson by variety,
and let the children see that the building up of a vocabulary
can be an exciting game.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>The Teacher’s Opportunity</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>Perhaps with no class has the seventh grade teacher a
greater opportunity for a fine and helpful influence than she
has with the spelling class. Her pupils will be judged, in
later years, by their speech. She may, by careful teaching,
expand their vocabularies so that they have a broad range,
and she may likewise secure an accuracy in enunciation
which will reflect great credit on her teaching. However,
this training must carry over into all other class work in
the grade to attain its greatest effectiveness.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Reviews</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>A review of many troublesome words previously taught
is given at the beginning. Many reviews should be given
during the year. These should be determined by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>teacher and should emphasize all words that have presented
difficulty to the class or to individuals.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Proper Names</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>In the class work in Geography and History the pupil
is confronted with a great many proper names. Fortunately
most of these are spelled as they sound. For a pupil who
has been properly taught such words present no difficulties.
The important point is to see that they are correctly pronounced
when first used. There are, however, many proper
names that have spelling peculiarities. The great importance
of impressing these upon the pupil’s mind is quite obvious.
This should be done in connection with the regular
class work as they have occasion to use the names. The
seventh grade teacher should be especially vigilant and see
that all proper names are correctly spelled, particularly with
regard to the capital letter.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Vocabulary</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The alphabetical vocabulary may be used for review
lessons and for looking up words. Its use helps to encourage
the dictionary habit.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SUGGESTIONS FOR EIGHTH YEAR</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Review</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The eighth grade teacher should read carefully the directions
for the seventh grade. She should know what has
been done and what has been left undone. In many
schools she completes the teaching of spelling. While
wasting no time in unnecessary reviews, she may wisely
give a careful test at the beginning and learn her problems.
The work in word building, by means of synonyms and
derivatives, should be continued.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Prefixes and Suffixes</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The work of the eighth grade continues the work of the
seventh grade in word building by a careful study of prefixes
and suffixes. The addition of a prefix or a suffix makes
a longer word and, because it is longer, the word becomes
harder to visualize as a whole. It is highly important that
the root part of the word should be pointed out, and it will
be found that in most cases it is a familiar word. When
this is true the prefix or the suffix becomes the part which
needs to be drilled upon and emphasized. On pages 48 to
54 are given a list of words having troublesome endings.
On pages 48, 49, and 50, for example, are words ending in
<i>ent</i>, <i>ant</i>, <i>ence</i>, and <i>ance</i>. These should be taught by groups
and, after the whole page has been carefully taught and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>studied, drill lessons and reviews should be given until the
pupil has the endings learned. These reviews will tax the
ingenuity of the teacher that they may be interesting and
not merely a mechanical word drill. Attention may well
be called to the fact that the plural of nouns ending in
<i>ant</i> and <i>ent</i> have the same pronunciation as the corresponding
words ending in <i>ance</i> and <i>ence</i>. If given in a sentence the
meaning will clearly show him which one is meant. Care
must be used that confusion does not result. Thoughtful
teaching is important.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Review of Rules</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>During the work of the preceding grades the important
rules for spelling have been developed. On pages 54, 56,
and 57, they are given for review with many illustrations.
In addition, Lessons 30, 38, and 39, give some exceptions to
these rules. These lessons should be thoroughly reviewed
until the correct spelling is established.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Words Having Two Pronunciations</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>At the close of the year’s work is given a list of 28 words
spelled alike but accented differently. The difference in
meaning should be emphasized, each word used in a sentence
to impress the correct pronunciation, and the pupils
taught to discriminate as to the form that should be used.</p>

<h3 class='c009'><span class='sc'>Vocabulary</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>As in previous grades much use may be made of the
alphabetical vocabulary for purposes of review and reference.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>
  <h2 class='c005'><span class='sc'>Appendix</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Following the vocabulary the teacher will find some special
lists, placed there for reference. They will provide some
very interesting supplementary lessons. They are:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. A list of words used in medicine, and the names of
diseases. Many of these present difficulties. Their teaching
is optional with the teacher.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. A list of words having more than one correct spelling.
The simpler spelling is usually the one to be preferred.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. A list of words frequently mispronounced. The
teacher should know this list and by it check the pupil’s
pronunciation.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. A list of foreign words which have come into more or
less frequent use in our language. The correct pronunciation
should be noted.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Two lists of foreign words and phrases, chiefly from
the French and Latin. Though only a small percentage
of the pupils will use these in writing they occur with such
frequency in the books which they will read that it is desirable
that they shall have access to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. A list of common abbreviations. These need to be
learned since their use is frequent.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
